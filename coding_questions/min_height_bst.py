# GENERAL NOTES

## It took me the 2-3 minutes to think and plan out strategy
  - Want to traverse the array as if we're doing binary search
  - Want to make a recursive functuin placeholder to pass in indices


## It took me the rest of the time to code and struggle
- I took a extra 10 minutes to 

## I had no time left to wrap up code and explain examples + walkthrough

## I had no time to get to another solution

## Took 15 mins extra to sift through errors

## Watched a Neetcode video on this exact problem, mimicked it in solution 3

## TOTAL TIME: 30min (+15min extra, +5min for this reflection) = 45-50 minutes

# REFLECTIONS


What went well:
- I was able to devise a strategy quick
- I was able to divide my functionality up well
- I was able to put up a placeholder function while explaining in stride


What went wrong:
- I forgot to ask clarifying questions 
  - This hurt me when I didn't think to use the insert function
  - I passed in too many parameters to the BST class because of this
- I messed up using python splicing (e.g didn't put first index)
- I didn't know whether I should've floored the midpoint or not
