## Feedback
### Well
  - Took a pause on the questions before quickly answering them
    - 
  - The energy was up the whole time
    - 

### Bad
  - Elaborate more on "what are you looking for profession wise?"
    - When answering why you want to be a software engineer:
      - Explain what TYPE of engineer you would be 
      - What values are you trying to get 

  - "What are some technical challenges you forsee in the furture?"
    - Be careful about talking about AI or Machine learning
      - It is VERY specialized area (usually need your Masters or PHD)
      - Don't talk about Blockchain or crypto -> 99.1% of Bloomberg doesn't work on there
      - Don't get trapped in a "buzz word" game --> Not a good look
      - Bloomberg is specific again "crypto" 

### Borderline
  - Be careful on using the word "off-brand" when explaining previous tech-stacks using in prior experience
    - These "off-brand" services are used because of a conscious decision to optimize solutions to 
    - Might make you seem like you didn't like the services
    - Might make you seem
    - Maybe say "propriertary" or "internal" or "specialized" tool
      - Doesn't solve everybody elses problems but rather their own specific use cases 
    - Try to make it a story better
      - Don't just jump into the underlying technologies that your projects encompassed
      - Don't just talk about the technical challenges 

###  Questions I asked
- How does bloomberg get everyone on board to pipeline?
- What are your experiences that you had with your current team?
- How often does your team build services that other Bloomerg engineers can use?
