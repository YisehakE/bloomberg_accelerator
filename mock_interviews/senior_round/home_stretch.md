# Summary
## The prep is all the accumulated work I've done. It's the combined efforts from the accelerator and personal prep I've followed through on, and the conversations I've had with the helpful contributers listed at the bottom. It's been a journey, but it doens't stop here - no matter the outcome. I enjoyed what I've learned and the connections I've made not only in the accelerator but also on campus, AFROTECH, and ColorStack. I understand my worth, and I'm grateful that these people helped actualized that potential to allow me to shine. I hope to make myself and all those involved proud
