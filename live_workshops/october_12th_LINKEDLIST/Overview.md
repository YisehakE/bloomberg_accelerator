## My Fact and Question
- Fact: Linked List are not contiguos in memory

- Question: Are singly linked list every used?
- Answer:
  - They are not common in practice
  - Sometimes used in embedded systems
    - Use up less memory and a doubly linked list


## Intro + Tips on Linked list
- If you struggle using one point w/ linked list, then use 2. If you're struggle with just 2, then use 3!
- Always draw out the linked list, helps with understanding
- Common edge case 
  - Empty linked list, single node, or cycles in a list
- Linked Lists get used usually applicable as a queue 

- To a question (what if you don't like using linked list and hate it?)
  - Answer: 
    - Honestly, LinkedList is probably the easiest structure to get down
    - Easy to understand the time and space complexity 
    - You don't have to like a structure to not prep for it
- Linked List is just point management at the end of the day
- Sometimes if stuck, think about how the solution would be solved with a array


## Group Algoexpert problem(s)
- remove the K node
- reverse the linkedlist 
- Group members:
  - Paulo Campolina (Engineer)
  - Emmanuel Mora
  - Ude Morah


## Removing the K Node from the end
- Given a linked list and value k...

### Self reflection
- Had a hard time understanding what Ude was trying to get at w/ pointers
- The drawing helped a bit


## Reverse the linkedlist 
- Given a linked list

- Contstraints:
  - Cannot create a new linked list

### Self reflection

- Thought of brute force first with stack
- Utilizing pointers for optimized space
  - Very ingenious solution
