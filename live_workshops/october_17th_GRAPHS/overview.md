## Engineer tips
Ask clarifying questions

Think of edge cases (either at the start, or then let them know that you'll address them later)

Proactively tell the interviewer that you will be testing your algorithm with different test cases (at some point during the interview)

Discuss your approach out loud before coding

Start with the sub-optimal approach first, if that's what comes to you first

Write short var and function names, but tell your interviewer that it's for the sake of time, and that you would give it a more meaningful name like "___"

If you see an opportunity for refactoring your code, point it out to the interviewer, tell them you'll come back to it if you have time.


## My questions on graphs
1) Original: When should we know when to transform a input into a graph?
2) Follow-up: Would the trade-off for transforming input into graph be worth it for the space it takes up?

## Ansser
1) 
- Knowing your data and what it's needed for. Is there a relationship between the data? An conceptionally, do these datasets 
have children? (2 at most, BST), all other cases are general graph...

2)
- If input already given as graph...
  - Then use that representation of nodes and edges

- If input not already given as graph...
  - Consider if question has other solution than graph
  - If cannot find other strategy, then try with graph

### What problems can be represented as graphs
- Physial places 
- Flights
- Connections of friends
- Series of steps/actions
  - More abstract use case

## When graphs used in real world and when is it appropriate
- DAGS are used installation for compilier packages
- Maintenance of structure is equally as important as the efficiency a solution takes
  - Even though they are space heavy, maintenance is really useful
