## Amazon project 2022

I built a tooling service for internal Amazonians to be able to collect a backlog of event data
that may have went missing on the customer side. This was under the CloudTrail infrastructure, and
I managed to design a entry point for a lambda function to handle comparisions to the single source of truth
in our databases and analyze each ORC files in partitioned buckets on S3 to retrieve said data

I spearheaded the automation of this process within the team, before clients 

I used python for the scripting with Boto3 as a useful library, along with typescript to integrate the AWS functionality
