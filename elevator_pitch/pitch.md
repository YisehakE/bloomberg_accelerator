# Intro


## Casual Description

- I am an undergrad senior majoring in Computer Science major and minoring in Entrepreneurship Management at Johns Hopkins University! I have worked extensively as an engineering technician and a software engineer at the US Naval Research Laboratory and Amazon respectively. My other endeavors include providing mentorship with organizations and privately, pursuing entrepreneurial ventures as a team lead, developing personal projects in and outside the classroom, dancing as a hobby and for my culture, and meditating on trails in the midst of nature.


## Technical Description

UPDATE



## HopHustle project

- HopHustle is a web application that a team of 4 and I developed in a course called Object Oriented Software Engineering, and that I continued working on as a personal coding and venture project.

- I utilized a PERN stack to develop an app that helps studens on campus


- I was very excited and motivated by the support our professor exclaimed that I took it upon myself to continue working the app during this past summer, working both on implementation and now the venture side of HopHustle. I have implemented new features such as a trending discovery page, live feed for client requests, and a landing page that stands out along with just maintaining what we've already built.

UPDATE


## CommUnity project

UPDATE

CommUnity is an web application that a team of 6 and I developed in a course called Computer Science Innovation & Entrepreneurship, and not only that, we also hashed out the business venture along with it!

We implemented this application with a fun & intereting tech stack of Next.js and Supabase, a new database similiar to Firebase but has these cool features of built-in authentication that we were able to tweak for our Johns Hopkins SSO logins and built-in buckets that we utilized to capture the users media uploads. We coded in Typescript, along with using Open AI ChatGPT open sourced AI, implemented a personalized chat feature where users can ask away about specific information about events or about the club and organizations themselves. 

I was able to implement many of the different flows for the site, including the search filtering or the modals for the homepage, along with the account page where I'd deal with the access policies for different types of users on our platform


## Amazon project 2022

I built a tooling service for internal Amazonians to be able to collect a backlog of event data
that may have went missing on the customer side. This was under the CloudTrail infrastructure, and
I managed to design a entry point for a lambda function to handle comparisions to the single source of truth
in our databases and analyze each ORC files in partitioned buckets on S3 to retrieve said data

I spearheaded the automation of this process within the team, before clients 

I used python for the scripting with Boto3 as a useful library, along with typescript to integrate the AWS functionality


## Amazon project 2021
